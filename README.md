# Unique number array builder - LABView Project

## This LabVIEW program lets you type unique numbers into a list.

### Key highlights
- It only adds a number if it's not already there.
- It stops when you have added ten different numbers or you hit the STOP button.
- It shows the sorted array, the smallest and biggest numbers.

### How it works?
- It uses the shift register to keep track of the list and update it.
- It uses Search 1D Array to check if a number is already in the list.
- The loop stops when the list is full or you can press the STOP button.
